# Machine_Learning_COVID19_detection_project
This project aims to wrangle data found on past COVID-19 patient cases and analyze what symptoms they are experiencing and prior medical conditions that may lead to the patient having a certain variant of COVID-19. This is a critical study that is purposed to give early detection of COVID-19 after filling out a simple survey. We can provide a probability towards the likelihood of COVID-19, but the user is encouraged to consult a doctor if they experience severe symptoms. 
This will increase public awareness of the common signs of COVID-19 and offer home remedies for minor problems that may reduce the symptoms. 

For example:
If someone claims they have a sore throat, we can ask them how long they have been experiencing this condition and suggest they try drinking a warm cup of turmeric milk. Curcumin in turmeric can help reduce swelling and soothe the throat, and the milk's warmth can help relieve pain. However, we will also urge the user to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis. 

This is a basic start to the readme file. We will add proper data, info, graphs in the future.
